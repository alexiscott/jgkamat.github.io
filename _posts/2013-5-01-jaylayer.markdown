description: The JayLayer project was a attempt to try to make sound easier to use in java. By default, java can only play  WAV files, and needs advanced libraries to play MP3 files. JayLayer fixes this problem, by abstracting away the advanced concepts of playing sounds, such as threading, so the user can focus on creating their program!
