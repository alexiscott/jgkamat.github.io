* NonFree Software
This page is mostly for testing out their usage, and evaluating whether it is worth including it into the rest of the blog.
* [[https://txtpen.com/][txtpen]]
Seems to be an easy to use highlighting tool
** Pros
1. Easy installation
2. Allows users to comment and interact with page
3. Requires no infrastructure on website's part
** Cons
1. Breaks footer colors
   - I'll probably report this at some point, but ~!important~ fixes it for now
2. Request to website must track users in some way
3. Dosen't seem to work always (when highlighting quickly)
4. Requires users use a google or txtpen account to highlight content
5. Requires javascript

* TODO Test
Here's some testing stuff to see if this will break!

- Source code blocks
  #+BEGIN_SRC sh :exports both :results output
  #!/bin/bash
  echo "My name is Jay" | sed 's/Jay/& Kamat/'
  if false; then
      echo hi
  fi
  #+END_SRC
- Tables
  | One   | Two  |
  |-------+------|
  | three | four |
  | five  | six  |
- Quotes
  #+BEGIN_QUOTE
  "There is no such thing as a typical user, and if there were, it wouldn't be you"

  #usability
  #+END_QUOTE
- $\LaTeX$

  Assume $\alpha=9$, $n=16$ and $x=0$.

  Stack grows until base case $2^{x}=n$.
- Some org Special Chars

  \alpha \beta \rightarrow \leftarrow \le \ge \sigma \Sigma

* Conclusion

Let me know via email or the txtpen highlights if you have any comments or concerns!
